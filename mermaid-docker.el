;;; Commentary:

;; This library attempts to create Mermaid graphs via mermaid-ink aka mermaid
;; as an API via a custom locally-built Docker image with restricted network
;; access, so that you are sure nothing gets out and your system is kept
;; isolated from random Node.js deps/files noise all around the filesystem.

;;; Code:


(provide 'mermaid-docker)
;;; mermaid-docker.el ends here
